Just down the coast from Puerto del Carmen is the stylish marina of Puerto Calero. Puerto Calero is an oasis of peace and tranquility in an area that is noted for its great natural beauty due to its volcanic origins that all together will give you an unforgettable experience. Puerto Calero is also notable for its careful attention paid to its security and cleanliness.

Puerto Calero has established itself as Lanzarote’s fourth resort. It’s home to high end shopping, a very interesting museum, some good bars and restaurants and very exciting local excursions and tours.
