I was very skeptical when a friend recently suggested I try acupuncture for my sinus problems.  Somewhat reluctantly I tried it and I was blown away that just after two visits plus a supplement, my sinus problems basically disappear.

I was in disbelief, I could not believe it.  After a week of being symptom free, I am kicking myself for not trying acupuncture before.

Learn from my mistake, if you have ever consider trying acupuncture go for it.

The results from acupuncture are very real in my case so I am now a believer

Note: The acupuncturist I saw did suggest I take a Chinese supplement called: **bi yan wan** which is supposed to treat rhinitis and sinus related problems
