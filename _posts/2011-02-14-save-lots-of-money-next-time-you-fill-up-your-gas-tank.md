### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow these 4 steps</span>:

## 1. Fill the tank in the early morning

The ambient temperature is lower than the ground. All service stations have their tanks located underground. The opposite happens during the day when the soil temperature rises and fuel tend to expand. For the latter, if you fill the tank at noon, afternoon or evening, a gallon of fuel will be exactly one gallon.

In the petroleum industry, the specific gravity and temperature of the soil play an important role.

## 2. Do not press the pump&#8217;s handle to the max

When you fill the tank, do not press the pump&#8217;s handle to the max.   Always choose the slowest mode and save more money.

The slower you pump, less steam is created.  If you press the handle to the max, is possible a small Portion of the fuel could flow into the gas station tanks

If the tank is filled to the maximum squeezing the handle a certain percentage of liquid entering the tank becomes vapor and returns through the supplier hose back into the tank. Thus, they get less fuel for your money.

## 3. Fill the tank before it gets to half empty

The more fuel in the tank the less air it has in it. Fuel evaporates more quickly than you think.

Refineries have large deposits with floating roofs, keeping the air separated from the fuel, in order to keep evaporation to a minimum.

## 4. Do not fill the tank when the gas station tanks are being filled or immediately after

If you arrive at the service station and see a tanker truck refilling the underground tanks or there were  just filled, avoid refueling at that time. Look for another station.
