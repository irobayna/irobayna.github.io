Personally I think we are getting too many x-rays, CT scans nowadays&#8230; many just ordered so the doctors make more money and not 100% necessary.

I have started to not get x-rays every 6 months at my dentist but rather once every two years.  They give me a hard time about it but it is my health and don&#8217;t want to get a superfluous x-ray just so they get some extra $$$
