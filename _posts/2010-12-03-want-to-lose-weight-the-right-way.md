I do&#8230; that&#8217;s why I have slowly got into running on daily.  At first, I could barely finish a mile, after 3 months I am happy to report I am running at least 3 miles a day.

There is a great iPhone + website to keep you motivated, it is called [RunKeeper][1]

With RunKeeper, you can basically keep track of all sort of activities, upload your progress and keep a current log of your activities, routes, etc on the website.  I find myself checking out the fitness reports where you can display how far have you run, for how long over a period of time.
