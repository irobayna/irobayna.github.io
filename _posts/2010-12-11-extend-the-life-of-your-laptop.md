I am the proud owner of a MacBook Pro laptop.  This laptop is quite an investment for me considering this is my first Mac and I am used to PC prices.  I am so happy I have switched to a Mac, I think they are worth every penny.

I am using my Mac for iPhone development and as I leave it running for many hours and even days at a time (long story), I noticed it seems to get \*very\* hot&#8230;  Everyone should recognize that the #1 hardware enemy is heat, so I purchase a laptop cooling station.

The laptop cooling station, I am happy to report really does work.  So if you are on the fence about getting one..do it! you will not regret it
