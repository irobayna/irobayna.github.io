Git is a **free & open source, distributed version control system** designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

**Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository** with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server. **Branching and merging are fast** and easy to do.
