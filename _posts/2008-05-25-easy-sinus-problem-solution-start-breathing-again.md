After years and years of having problems with my nose, even getting surgery, I have found the solution that works for me, it is a natural solution and I feel I am breathing easier and better.

After being really frustrated by my poor breathing, I talk to my doctor who prescribed Nasonex.  I took it on a daily basis for years.  I could breathe better when I took the medicine but it was not a cure, it just manage my symptoms.

I wanted to get better, so a friend recommended a Neti Pot.  Say what? Well, this is something that the Himalayan monks have been doing for a long, long time.  Basically you use something that looks like a tea pot and stream water up one nostril and the water will get out via the other one.   You do this procedure on both nostrils.  These pots are call <span style="border-color: initial !important; margin-top: 0px !important; margin-bottom: 0px !important; border-width: medium !important;"><a style="border: none;" href="<a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TFR6MG?ie=UTF8&tag=islasanallife-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000TFR6MG&quot;>SinuCleanse Nasal Wash System</a><img src=">Neti Pot</a></span>

I used my Neti Pot for a few months and then I came across this gadget which is really awesome: [SinuPulse Elite Advanced Nasal Sinus Irrigation System][1]<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=islasanallife-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001CWT4JI" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />

So, the bottom line, if you have allergies, or some other problem  with your sinuses, try rising your nostrils on a daily basis with a saline solution (warm water with sea salt) or if you have plenty of money to spend, buy the saline packets ready to mix ([NeilMed&#8217;s Sinus Rinse Pre-Mixed Packets, 100-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)][2]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=islasanallife-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B001G7QMYE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />).

Give yourself a month and see how you feel.  Hope this helps you!

Highly recommended!
