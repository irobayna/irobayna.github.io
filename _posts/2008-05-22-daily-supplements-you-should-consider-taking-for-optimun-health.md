  1. [Multi-vitamin][1]  &#8211; On my last physical my family doctor mentioned that it would be a good idea to start taking a multi-vitamin supplement everyday.  I have been a firm believer of multi-vitamins for a long time, so this was music to my ears.  There are many multi-vitamins available but some in my humble opinion are far better than others.  [SOLARAY ][2] is a great company and they make high quality vitamins.  Expensive but worth their price. This other ones are not bad either: [Life&#8217;s Essentials Plus (Multivitamin) by Vitabase][1]
  2. [Coenzyme Q10][3] &#8211; As an antioxidant, coenzyme Q-10 may also have potential as an anticancer and immune-stimulating agent. Coenzyme Q10&#8217;s antioxidant actions can stop the free-radical damage believed to cause certain cancers. Coenzyme Q10 may be used in cardiovascular disease, particularly in congestive heart failure. The heart muscle contains the greatest concentration of Coenzyme Q10 in the body. Coenzyme Q10 is thought to have a protective action on the cells of the heart. I like this one: [CoQ10 100mg by Vitabase][3]
  3. [Digestive Coenzymes][4] &#8211;  The body uses enzymes for all of its chemical actions and reactions. Digestive enzymes are produced in the salivary glands of the mouth and in the stomach, pancreas and small intestine, and are responsible for digestion of nutrients as well as their absorption, transportation, metabolization and elimination. Because enzymes are extremely sensitive to heat, many are harmed by modern food processing methods like microwaving and pasteurization, rendering them ineffective. I like this one:  [SuperZymes by Vitabase][4]
  4. Omega-3 &#8211; Omega-3 fatty acids benefit the heart of healthy people, and those at high risk of — or who have — cardiovascular disease.   In a clinical study, the Omega-3 in Coromega was shown to enter the bloodstream faster at three times the levels of a fish oil product in softgel form.   
    I buy from Amazon regularly this product ([Coromega Omega-3 Supplement, Orange Flavor, Squeeze Packets, 90-Count Box][5]<img border="0" width="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=b0780-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000FFQATA" height="1" style="margin: 0px; border: medium none" />) and I love it.  I normally eat it by squeezng the product into a yogurt.  It takes great!!.
