[FlightStats][1] gives you an option to track a flight using Google Earth.  I believe this is really good as you can add the &#8216;Weather&#8217; layer onto Google Earth and see the route changes based on weather the flight makes.

There is a new kid on the block and it is called [FlightLite][2].  The website does not contain as many choices as FlightStats but the tracking flight task is very simple and it does a great job at it
