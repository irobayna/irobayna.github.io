Got new tires? Be careful you don&#8217;t get a tire that is over 6 years old.  It happen to me at a nationwide franchise.  I got a set of 4 tires.  2 were brand new and the other 2 were over 5 years old!!

A TV show called [20/20][1] (abc news) was airing a story called: [AGED TIRES: A HIDDEN DANGER ON THE ROAD?][2] about people having horrible car accidents due to their tires falling apart or blowing up.

These people were wondering how this was possible due that their tires were new. The deal was that the tires &#8220;look&#8221; new, they were bought recently, but they were manufactured years and years ago.  My understanding is that if a tire has been manufactured over 6 years ago, it should not be sold because it is dangerous. In the US the rubber manufacturing association opposed any sort of regulation being pass by congress on the subject.  But according to 20/20 in Europe there is a regulation that forbids or warns the customer that he/she is getting OLD tires.

How to read the tire manufactured date?

Look for the letters &#8220;DOT&#8221;, then look for a number series at the end .  The first 2 digits indicate the week of the year the tired was manufactured and the last 2 digits indicate the year.

<span style="font-size: 11.6667px;">If you look at the picture, you can see that this tire was manufactured the 27th week of 2007</span>
