Simple instructions:

From your iphone navigate to: <a href="http://www.unlockit.co.nz/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">http://www.unlockit.co.nz/</span></span></a> create a custom APN profile then install it.

Recently a customer of mine could not setup a VPN connection using 3G network due to an artificial limitation from its carrier original profile.  
By adding a new APN profile to your iphone, you can go around the original behavior.
