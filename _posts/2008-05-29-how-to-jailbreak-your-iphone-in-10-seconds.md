If you are an iPhone user and want to play with all the native applications available for the iPhone, your only choices are to wait for Apple to release the new Firmware (June 2008 ??) or basically jailbreak your iPhone.

iPhones are not cheap but they are worth every penny.  The last thing you want to do is do something to break this great gadget.  Well, there is a piece of software called [Ziphone ][1]that will jail break your phone in a matter of seconds.

For those that don&#8217;t know, jailbreak means to open the iPhone so you can run native applications via an awesome program called the installer.    The installer basically works like a program / package manager.  Where you select from a list of available applications the one you would like to install and over the Edge or WiFi network the application will be downloaded and install in your iPhone (normally within seconds)  Very effortless process.  I love this process for installing applications due that it allows a novice user or an expert to install application quickly without making mistakes and breaking something within the phone.

The number of available applications is impressible.  You can spend many hours just looking at all the available applications.  I am putting together a list of the top 10 applications that should be available shortly.

The steps to jailbreak the iphone with ziphone are real easy:

  1. download and run ziphone (select jailbreak only)
  2. plug your iphone
  3. follow ziphone instructions, this step should take just a few seconds
