A Blog about life, science, finances and technology

Here you will be able to hopefully find some &#8220;golden nuggets &#8221; of information, stuff that is useful and of value.

I have been working as a Software Engineer for the last 18 years. Mainly doing systems design, coding and database development.  My favorite tools at the moment: Delphi 2007, Visual Studio 2008 and SQL Server 2008.   I try to read at least a physical newspaper everyday (The Wall Street Journal) also I read several financial and business magazines on a monthly basis.  But my heart is in technology,  I am technologist at heart (is that a real word?).  I am a native Spanish speaker and English is my  second language. So **I want to apologize** now for all the grammatical and misspellings you will come across on my blog.  Sorry!  <img src="http://blogs.bikecrawler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />

Enjoy life and be kind to strangers!
